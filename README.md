### Building a Modern Computer from First Principles

This repository includes all assignments I did in the course called Nand2tetris.

This course is avaliable on Coursera and [this website](http://www.nand2tetris.org/)

The site contains all the software tools and project materials necessary to build a general-purpose computer system from the ground up. We also provide a set of lectures designed to support a typical course on the subject.

The materials are aimed at students, instructors, and self-learners. Everything is free and open-source; as long as you operate in a non-profit educational setting, you are welcome to modify and use our materials as you see fit.

The Nand2Tetris course consists of a series of 14 learning modules. Each module consists of a project, a lecture, and a book chapter.

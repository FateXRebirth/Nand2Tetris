### Building a Modern Computer from First Principles

This repository includes all assignments I did in the course called Nand2tetris.

This course is avaliable on Coursera and [this website](http://www.nand2tetris.org/)

The site contains all the software tools and project materials necessary to build a general-purpose computer system from the ground up. We also provide a set of lectures designed to support a typical course on the subject.

The materials are aimed at students, instructors, and self-learners. Everything is free and open-source; as long as you operate in a non-profit educational setting, you are welcome to modify and use our materials as you see fit.

The Nand2Tetris course consists of a series of 14 learning modules. Each module consists of a project, a lecture, and a book chapter.

The materials also support two courses that we now teach in Coursera:

Nand2Tetris Part I (hardware, projects/chapters 1-6) is offered as an on-demand course that learners take at their own pace. Here is a two-minute video promo of this course.

1. Boolean Logic
2. Boolean Arithmetic
3. Sequential Logic
4. Machine Language
5. Computer Architecture
6. Assembler

Nand2Tetris Part II (software, projects/chapters 7-12): is also offered on Coursera, in the same format.

7. VM I: Stack Arithmetic 
8. VM II: Program Control 
9. High-Level Language
10. Compiler I: Syntax Analysis
11. Compiler II: Code Generation
12. Operating System
